# SECURITY NOTICE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Critical Security Issue Detected

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Status**: ACTION REQUIRED

### Issue
During the audit process, Supabase credentials from the `.env` file were exposed in the audit report. While `.env` is properly excluded from version control (`.gitignore`), the credentials need to be rotated as a precautionary measure.

### Required Actions

1. **Rotate Supabase Keys Immediately**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xnijhggwgbxrtvlktviz/settings/api
   - Navigate to: Settings → API → Project API Keys
   - Click "Reset" on the `anon` (public) key
   - Update the new key in your `.env` file
   - Restart your development server

2. **Verify .env Security** ✅
   - `.env` is already in `.gitignore`
   - Never commit `.env` to version control
   - Only use `.env.example` for templates

3. **Review Access Logs**
   - Check Supabase dashboard for any suspicious activity
   - Review RLS policy violations (if any)

### Post-Rotation Checklist
- [ ] New `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` updated in `.env`
- [ ] Development server restarted
- [ ] Application tested and working
- [ ] Old key confirmed disabled in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Team members notified of key change

### Additional Security Recommendations
1. Enable MFA for Supabase account
2. Set up IP restrictions (if available on your plan)
3. Monitor API usage for anomalies
4. Consider using Vault or similar for production secrets
