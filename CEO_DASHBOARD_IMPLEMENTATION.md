```

**Step 4:** Verify modeled views

### Audit Logging
All actions are logged in the `audit_logs` table:

- Visibility changes
- Share grants/revokes
- Downloads

### RLS Policies
All CEO staging tables enforce Row-Level Security:

-- Only CEO and admin roles can read
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM profiles
  WHERE profiles.user_id = auth.uid()
  AND profiles.role IN ('ceo', 'admin')
)
```
