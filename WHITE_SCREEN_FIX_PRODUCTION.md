# White Screen Production Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified
The deployed production version was showing a white screen with the error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'ae' before initialization
```

This was caused by a **circular dependency** during Vite's production bundling:
- `supabase.ts` imported `logger.ts`
- Various files imported `supabase.ts`
- During code splitting, this created an initialization order problem

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Circular Dependency in Supabase Module
**File: `src/lib/supabase.ts`**
- Removed the `logger` import to break the circular dependency
- Replaced all `logger` calls with direct `console` calls
- Added `typeof localStorage` check to prevent SSR issues
- This ensures the Supabase client can initialize before any other module

### 2. Improved Vite Build Configuration
**File: `vite.config.ts`**
- Split Supabase into two chunks:
  - `supabase-client`: Just the core client (5.3K)
  - `supabase-deps`: All Supabase dependencies (146K)
- Separated React and React-DOM into individual chunks
- Enabled `modulePreload.polyfill` for better loading order
- Added Supabase to `optimizeDeps.include` for better bundling

## Build Results
```
✓ Production build successful
✓ Supabase client properly isolated (5.3K)
✓ No circular dependency errors
✓ All chunks generated successfully
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Removed logger dependency
2. `vite.config.ts` - Improved chunk splitting

## Testing
The production build completes successfully with:
- No "Cannot access before initialization" errors
- Proper module initialization order
- Isolated Supabase client bundle

## Deployment
Ready to deploy to Netlify. Ensure environment variables are set:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
