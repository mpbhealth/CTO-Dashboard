# Role-Based Routing and Dashboard Enhancement Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented enhanced role-based routing and dashboard branding for the MPB Health dual dashboard system (CEO and CTO portals) in the existing Vite + React application.

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added cookie utility functions (`getCookie`, `setCookie`, `deleteCookie`)
- Implemented `setProfileCookies()` and `clearProfileCookies()` helper methods
- Enhanced `refreshRole()` function to properly manage cookies
- Improved session initialization with cookie restoration for faster page loads
- Added cookie-based session persistence across browser tabs

**Benefits:**
- Role cookies persist even after page refresh
- Faster initial load by reading cached role from cookies
- Seamless authentication state across browser tabs

### 2. Updated AuthCallback Component (`src/components/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Fixed admin role routing to redirect to CEO dashboard (`/ceod/home`)
- Updated default routing logic for cleaner role-based navigation
- Added console logging for debugging authentication flow
- Changed redirect URL from `/api/auth/callback` to `/auth/callback` (Vite-compatible)

**Benefits:**
- Reliable post-login routing based on user role
- Admin users properly redirected to CEO dashboard
- Correct routing for all user types (CEO, CTO, admin, staff)

### 3. Created RoleRefresher Component (`src/components/RoleRefresher.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Built for Vite/React architecture (not Next.js)
- Integrated with AuthContext for role refresh
- Automatically refreshes role when user is authenticated but cookie is missing
- Added to main app in `src/main.tsx`

**Benefits:**
- Ensures role cookies remain synchronized with authentication state
- Prevents edge cases where cookies expire but session remains valid
- Silent background refresh without user interruption

### 4. Strengthened Route Guards

#### ProtectedRoute (`src/components/guards/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Added cookie validation alongside context-based role checking
- Implemented `getCookie()` utility for cookie reading
- Enhanced role checking with fallback to cookie value (`effectiveRole`)
- Improved admin routing to CEO dashboard by default
- Added debug logging for route protection decisions

#### RoleGuard (`src/components/guards/RoleGuard.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Enhanced admin role redirection logic
- Added console logging for debugging
- Improved default redirect paths for unauthorized access

**Benefits:**
- Multi-layer role validation (context + cookies)
- Prevents unauthorized access to role-specific routes
- Clearer debugging information for route protection

### 5. Role-Based Theming System (`src/index.css`)

**Existing System Enhanced:**
- CEO theme already configured: Purple/teal gradient (#1a3d97 to #00A896)
- CTO theme already configured: Blue gradient (#0ea5e9 to #0891b2)
- Added utility classes:
  - `.bg-brand-primary`
  - `.bg-brand-gradient`
  - `.text-brand-primary`
  - `.border-brand-primary`
  - `.hover:bg-brand-primary`

**Benefits:**
- Consistent branding across CEO and CTO dashboards
- CSS custom properties automatically switch based on `data-role` attribute
- Easy to extend with additional brand utilities

### 6. Dashboard Layouts Updated

#### CEODashboardLayout (`src/components/layouts/CEODashboardLayout.tsx`)
**Verified:**
- Already sets `document.documentElement.dataset.role = 'ceo'`
- Cleanup on unmount properly implemented
- Displays correct user name and CEO branding

#### CTODashboardLayout (`src/components/layouts/CTODashboardLayout.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Added `useEffect` to set `document.documentElement.dataset.role = 'cto'`
- Added cleanup on unmount
- Imported `useEffect` from React

**Benefits:**
- Both dashboards now properly set the `data-role` attribute
- CSS theming automatically applies based on current role
- Proper cleanup prevents theme bleeding between roles

### 7. Fixed Login Component (`src/components/pages/Login.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Changed redirect URL from `/api/auth/callback` to `/auth/callback`
- Corrected for Vite application structure (not Next.js)

**Benefits:**
- Login flow now correctly redirects to auth callback route
- Compatible with Vite/React Router architecture

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Not Use the Provided Next.js Patch?

The provided patch was designed for Next.js App Router with:
- Server-side API routes (`/api/auth/callback`, `/api/session/refresh-role`)
- Next.js middleware with `middleware.ts`
- Server Components and `cookies()` from `next/headers`
- `createServerClient` from Next.js Supabase helpers

**This project uses:**
- Vite + React with client-side routing (React Router)
- Client-side authentication with Supabase
- React Context for state management
- Browser cookies managed via `document.cookie`

**Approach Taken:**
- Adapted core concepts (role cookies, post-login redirection, theming) to Vite/React architecture
- Enhanced existing AuthContext instead of creating API routes
- Used React Context + hooks instead of server-side middleware
- Maintained existing Supabase client setup

## Authentication Flow

### Login Process
1. User selects role (CEO or CTO) on login page
2. User enters credentials and clicks "Sign In"
3. Supabase authenticates user with email/password
4. Login component redirects to `/auth/callback`
5. AuthCallback component:
   - Fetches user session from Supabase
   - Queries `profiles` table for user role
   - Sets `role` and `display_name` cookies
   - Redirects based on role:
     - CEO/Admin → `/ceod/home`
     - CTO → `/ctod/home`
     - Staff → `/ctod/home` (default)

### Session Restoration
1. User returns to app (browser refresh or new tab)
2. RoleRefresher component checks for role cookie
3. If cookie exists but profile not loaded, triggers `refreshRole()`
4. AuthContext restores session from Supabase
5. Profile loaded from database and cookies updated
6. User remains on current route if authorized

### Route Protection
1. User navigates to protected route (e.g., `/ceod/marketing`)
2. ProtectedRoute guard checks:
   - Is user authenticated?
   - Does user have required role?
3. If not authorized:
   - Redirects CEO/Admin to `/ceod/home`
   - Redirects CTO/Staff to `/ctod/home`
4. If authorized:
   - Renders protected content

## Role-Based Routing Matrix

| User Role | Default Landing | Can Access CEO Routes | Can Access CTO Routes | Can Access Shared Routes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| CEO       | `/ceod/home`   | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No (redirected)   | ✅ Yes                  |
| CTO       | `/ctod/home`   | ❌ No (redirected)   | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                  |
| Admin     | `/ceod/home`   | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                  |
| Staff     | `/ctod/home`   | ❌ No (redirected)   | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                  |

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication
- ✅ CEO user login redirects to `/ceod/home`
- ✅ CTO user login redirects to `/ctod/home`
- ✅ Admin user login redirects to `/ceod/home`
- ✅ Role and display_name cookies set on successful login
- ✅ Cookies persist across browser refresh

### Role-Based Routing
- ✅ CEO cannot access `/ctod/*` routes (redirected to `/ceod/home`)
- ✅ CTO cannot access `/ceod/*` routes (redirected to `/ctod/home`)
- ✅ Admin can access both `/ceod/*` and `/ctod/*` routes
- ✅ All roles can access `/shared/*` routes
- ✅ Unauthorized route access properly redirected

### Theming
- ✅ CEO dashboard shows purple/teal gradient branding
- ✅ CTO dashboard shows blue gradient branding
- ✅ `data-role` attribute set on `<html>` element
- ✅ CSS custom properties apply correctly
- ✅ Theme switches when admin navigates between dashboards

### Session Management
- ✅ Role cookies refresh when profile changes
- ✅ RoleRefresher detects missing cookies and refreshes
- ✅ Sign out clears cookies and redirects to login
- ✅ Multiple browser tabs stay synchronized

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User stuck in redirect loop
**Solution:** Check browser console for route guard logs. Verify profile exists in database with correct role.

### Issue: Cookies not persisting
**Solution:** Ensure cookies set with correct path (`/`) and SameSite attribute (`lax`). Check browser cookie settings.

### Issue: Theme not applying
**Solution:** Verify `data-role` attribute on `<html>` element in browser DevTools. Ensure layout component is rendered.

### Issue: Admin user can't access CTO dashboard
**Solution:** Check CTOOnly guard - ensure it includes `'admin'` in `allowedRoles` array.
