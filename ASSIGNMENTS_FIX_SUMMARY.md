# Assignments Table Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was showing an error: "Failed to load assignments. Please make sure you're connected to Supabase."

## Root Cause Analysis

### Schema Mismatch
The database schema had evolved through multiple migrations, creating inconsistencies:

1. **Status Field Mismatch**:
   - Database default: `'pending'`
   - Application expects: `'todo'`, `'in_progress'`, `'done'`

2. **Foreign Key References**:
   - Earlier migrations referenced `auth.users(id)`
   - Latest migration (20251014140000) references `users(id)`
   - Application code was inconsistent

3. **Missing Fields**:
   - Database had `assigned_by` and `priority` fields
   - TypeScript types were missing these fields

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Migration
**File**: `supabase/migrations/fix_assignments_schema_alignment.sql`

- Updated status default from `'pending'` to `'todo'`
- Migrated existing `'pending'` records to `'todo'`
- Added proper CHECK constraint: `status IN ('todo', 'in_progress', 'done')`
- Created performance indexes on key columns
- Added/verified `updated_at` trigger
- Ensured `users` table has proper `auth_user_id` column

### 2. RLS Policy Fix
**File**: `supabase/migrations/add_users_insert_policy.sql`

- Added INSERT policy for users table to allow profile creation
- Updated SELECT policy to allow all authenticated users to read user records
- This enables automatic user profile creation when users first authenticate
- Critical for the assignments feature to work properly

### 3. TypeScript Type Definitions
**File**: `src/types/Assignment.ts`

Updated interfaces to match database schema:
- Added `assigned_by` field
- Added `priority` field
- Added `project_name` field (for joined data)
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 4. Database Verification

Confirmed the following are working correctly:
- ✅ `assignments` table exists
- ✅ Status field defaults to `'todo'`
- ✅ CHECK constraint enforces valid status values
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ RLS policies allow authenticated users to read/manage assignments
- ✅ Foreign keys properly reference `users(id)`
- ✅ Performance indexes created
- ✅ `updated_at` trigger configured

## Current Database State

### Assignments Table Schema
```sql
- id: uuid (PRIMARY KEY, auto-generated)
- title: text (NOT NULL)
- description: text
- assigned_to: uuid → users(id)
- assigned_by: uuid → users(id)
- project_id: uuid → projects(id)
- due_date: date
- priority: text (DEFAULT 'medium')
- status: text (DEFAULT 'todo', CHECK: 'todo'|'in_progress'|'done')
- created_at: timestamptz
- updated_at: timestamptz
```

### RLS Policies

**Assignments Table:**
- "Authenticated users can read assignments" - SELECT for authenticated (allows viewing all assignments)
- "Authenticated users can manage assignments" - ALL for authenticated (allows full CRUD operations)

**Users Table:**
- "Authenticated users can read users" - SELECT for authenticated (allows looking up user information)
- "Users can insert their own profile" - INSERT for authenticated (allows auto-creation of user profiles)
- "Users can update their own profile" - UPDATE for authenticated (allows users to update their own data)

### Indexes
- `idx_assignments_status`
- `idx_assignments_assigned_to`
- `idx_assignments_project_id`
- `idx_assignments_due_date`
- `idx_assignments_created_at` (DESC)

## Application Integration

The `useAssignments` hook should now work correctly:
1. Connects to Supabase using environment variables
2. Queries assignments table with proper foreign key relationships
3. Joins with `users` table to get employee information
4. Respects RLS policies for authenticated users
5. Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Flow**: Ensure users can log in and their profile is created in the `users` table
2. **Create Assignment**: Test creating a new assignment
3. **View Assignments**: Verify the assignments list loads without errors
4. **Update Assignment**: Test editing assignment details
5. **Delete Assignment**: Confirm deletion works
6. **Status Filter**: Test filtering by status (todo/in_progress/done)
7. **Project Filter**: Test filtering by project

## Next Steps

The assignments feature should now be fully functional. If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Supabase connection in `.env` file
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Ensure user record exists in `users` table with `auth_user_id` linked to `auth.users`
4. Check browser console for specific error messages
5. Review Supabase logs for RLS policy violations

## Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xnijhggwgbxrtvlktviz.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

The connection has been verified and is working correctly.
