# Note Sharing System Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive note-sharing system has been implemented for CEO and CTO dashboards, allowing independent note management with controlled sharing and collaboration capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Independent Dashboards
- **CEO Dashboard**: Has its own private notepad
- **CTO Dashboard**: Has its own private notepad
- Each dashboard maintains complete isolation by default
- Notes are tagged with owner_role ('ceo' or 'cto') to ensure proper segregation

### 2. Note Creation Modes

#### Personal Notes
- Create private notes visible only to the creator
- Stored with owner_role matching the current dashboard
- Not shared by default

#### Create For Other Dashboard
- Create a note specifically for the other role
- Automatically shares upon creation
- Sends both in-app and email notifications
- Choose permission level: View Only or Can Edit
- Optional message when sharing

### 3. Sharing Capabilities

#### Share Existing Notes
- Any note can be shared after creation
- Share with entire role (CEO or CTO dashboard)
- Set permission levels:
  - **View Only**: Recipients can see but not edit
  - **Can Edit**: Recipients can view and modify the note
- Add optional message when sharing
- Visual indicators show shared status

#### Unshare Notes
- Owner can revoke sharing at any time
- Unshare removes access for recipients
- Notification sent when access is removed

### 4. Notification System

#### In-App Notifications
- Real-time notification badge showing unread count
- Notification dropdown with recent activity
- Notification types:
  - Note shared with you
  - Shared note edited
  - Access removed
  - New comment (future)
- Click notification to view note
- Mark individual or all as read

#### Email Notifications
- Beautiful HTML email templates
- Sent for all sharing events
- Includes note preview and context
- Direct link to dashboard
- Sharer information and permission level

### 5. Collaboration Features
- Edit permissions allow recipients to modify shared notes
- Notes update in real-time via Supabase Realtime
- Edit attribution shows who made changes
- Version history tracked (timestamp based)

### 6. User Interface

#### View Modes
- **All Notes**: Shows both personal and shared notes
- **My Notes**: Only notes created by current user
- **Shared With Me**: Only notes others have shared

#### Visual Indicators
- Personal notes: Default styling
- Shared notes you own: Green badge with "Shared" label
- Shared notes from others: Blue badge with "Shared with you"
- Edit permissions: Clear indication of edit vs view-only

#### Search & Filter
- Search across all accessible notes
- Filter by view mode
- Real-time results

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Extended Notes Table
```sql
notes (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text,
  owner_role text CHECK (owner_role IN ('ceo', 'cto')),
  created_for_role text CHECK (created_for_role IN ('ceo', 'cto')),
  is_shared boolean DEFAULT false,
  is_collaborative boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
)
```

#### Note Shares Table
```sql
note_shares (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  note_id uuid REFERENCES notes(id),
  shared_by_user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  shared_with_user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  shared_with_role text CHECK (shared_with_role IN ('ceo', 'cto')),
  permission_level text CHECK (permission_level IN ('view', 'edit')),
  share_message text,
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
)
```

#### Note Notifications Table
```sql
note_notifications (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  note_id uuid REFERENCES notes(id),
  recipient_user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  notification_type text,
  is_read boolean DEFAULT false,
  sent_via text CHECK (sent_via IN ('in-app', 'email', 'both')),
  metadata jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz
)
```

#### Note Comments Table (Future)
```sql
note_comments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  note_id uuid REFERENCES notes(id),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  comment_text text,
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
)
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have comprehensive RLS policies:

#### Notes Policies
- Users can view their own notes
- Users can view notes shared with them
- Users can create notes
- Users can update their own notes
- Users can update shared notes if they have edit permission and the note is collaborative
- Users can delete their own notes

#### Note Shares Policies
- Users can view shares of their notes or shares where they are the recipient
- Users can share their own notes
- Users can update/delete shares of their own notes

#### Notifications Policies
- Users can view their own notifications
- System can create notifications
- Users can mark their notifications as read

### API Functions

## Database Migration

### Apply Migration

The migration file is located at:
```
supabase/migrations/20251031000001_create_note_sharing_system.sql
```

**To apply the migration:**

1. Using Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase db push
```

2. Or via Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste migration content
   - Execute

### Migration Steps

The migration automatically:
1. Renames `user_id` to `created_by` (if needed)
2. Adds new columns to notes table
3. Creates note_shares, note_notifications, note_comments tables
4. Backfills existing notes with owner_role from user profiles
5. Creates comprehensive RLS policies
6. Adds performance indexes
7. Creates helper functions

### Data Safety

- Uses `IF EXISTS` checks to prevent errors
- Preserves existing data during backfill
- Sets safe defaults for new columns
- No data loss during migration

## Security Considerations

### RLS Enforcement
- All access controlled at database level
- Users can only see their notes or notes shared with them
- Edit permissions strictly enforced
- No privilege escalation possible

### Data Isolation
- CEO notes isolated from CTO by default
- Sharing requires explicit action
- Owner maintains full control
- Unshare immediately revokes access

### Audit Trail
- All sharing actions logged
- Notification history preserved
- Created_by tracks ownership
- Timestamps on all actions

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- owner_role, created_by on notes
- note_id on note_shares
- recipient_user_id on notifications
- is_read on notifications (partial)
- All foreign keys indexed

### Query Optimization
- Separate queries for personal vs shared notes
- Pagination ready (LIMIT support)
- Efficient RLS policies
- Real-time subscriptions on relevant tables only

### Caching
- Real-time updates reduce refresh needs
- Client-side state management
- Optimistic UI updates

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Comments System**: Already has table, needs UI
2. **Version History**: Track all edits with diff view
3. **Rich Text Editor**: Format notes with markdown
4. **Attachments**: Add files to notes
5. **Bulk Sharing**: Share multiple notes at once
6. **Share with Individuals**: Beyond just roles
7. **Note Templates**: Predefined structures
8. **Reminders**: Set follow-up dates
9. **Tags & Categories**: Better organization
10. **Weekly Digest**: Summary email of activity

### Technical Improvements
1. Implement full comment system UI
2. Add push notifications (web push API)
3. Offline support with service workers
4. Export notes to PDF/Word
5. Note analytics (views, edits, etc.)
6. Advanced search with filters
7. Collaborative editing indicators
8. @mentions in notes

## Troubleshooting
