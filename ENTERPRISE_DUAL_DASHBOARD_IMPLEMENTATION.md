# Enterprise Dual Dashboard Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Core Infrastructure Complete
**Build Status:** ✅ Passing

## Overview

This implementation transforms the MPB Health dashboard into an enterprise-grade dual CEO/CTO system with proper role isolation, server-enforced security, and a shared data model that enables controlled collaboration between executives.

## Architecture Improvements Delivered

### 1. Database Foundation - Shared Data Model with RLS

#### New Tables Created

**`public.records`**
- Core table for all dashboard data (KPIs, reports, notes, files, campaigns, tasks)
- Fields: `id`, `org_id`, `owner_id`, `record_type`, `visibility`, `title`, `content`, `metadata`
- Visibility modes: `private` (owner only), `org` (all org members), `shared` (explicit grants)
- Automatic timestamp tracking with `updated_at` trigger

**`public.record_shares`**
- Join table for explicit sharing between users or roles
- Fields: `record_id`, `target_role`, `target_user`, `can_edit`, `granted_by`
- Supports sharing to roles (ceo, cto, admin, staff) or specific users
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate shares
- Audit logging trigger for all share/unshare actions

**`public.file_metadata`**
- Tracks uploaded files with visibility and access controls
- Links files to records via `record_id` foreign key
- Enforces same RLS policies as parent records
- Fields: `storage_path`, `filename`, `size_bytes`, `mime_type`, `visibility`, `owner_id`

#### RLS Policies Implemented

**SELECT Policies**
- Owner can always read their own records
- Org-wide visibility allows all org members to read
- Shared visibility requires explicit grant via `record_shares`
- Admin role bypasses all restrictions for support

**INSERT Policies**
- Owner must be current authenticated user
- Admin role can insert on behalf of others (delegation)

**UPDATE Policies**
- Owner can always update their records
- Users with `can_edit=true` share permission can update
- Admin role bypasses restrictions

**DELETE Policies**
- Owner only (preserves audit trail)
- Admin role can delete for compliance/cleanup

### 2. SQL Helper Functions

**`public.current_role()`**
- Returns role from profiles table for current auth user
- Used throughout RLS policies for role-based checks
- Stable, security definer function

**`public.is_admin()`**
- Returns true if user has admin role or is_superuser flag
- Enables admin UI access and RLS bypass

**`public.can_read_record(record_id uuid)`**
- Centralized function to check if user can read specific record
- Implements full visibility logic (owner, org, shared, admin)
- Used by file_metadata policies

**`public.can_edit_record(record_id uuid)`**
- Centralized function to check if user can edit specific record
- Checks ownership, explicit edit permission, or admin role
- Used by update policies

### 3. React Hooks for Data Management

**`useRecords(filters)`**
- Fetch records with filtering by type, visibility, or owner
- Integrated with React Query for caching and optimistic updates
- Auto-refetch on auth state changes

**`useRecord(recordId)`**
- Fetch single record by ID
- 2-minute stale time for performance

**`useCreateRecord()`**
- Mutation hook for creating new records
- Automatically sets owner_id to current user
- Invalidates records query on success

**`useUpdateRecord()`**
- Mutation hook for updating existing records
- Invalidates affected queries

**`useDeleteRecord()`**
- Mutation hook for deleting records
- Soft-delete support via metadata flag

**`useRecordShares(recordId)`**
- Fetch all shares for a specific record
- Includes profile information for target users
- 1-minute stale time

**`useShareRecord()`**
- Mutation hook for creating new shares
- Automatically updates record visibility to 'shared'
- Supports role-based and user-specific sharing

**`useUnshareRecord()`**
- Mutation hook for removing shares
- Automatically reverts visibility to 'private' if no remaining shares

**`useUpdateRecordVisibility()`**
- Mutation hook for changing visibility level
- Validates permissions before update

### 4. UI Components

**`RecordShareModal`**
- Comprehensive modal for managing record sharing
- Three visibility levels with visual indicators (private, org, shared)
- Role-based sharing (CEO ↔ CTO, staff)
- Edit permission toggle
- Live share list with remove functionality
- Success feedback and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design

**`RecordVisibilityBadge`**
- Visual indicator for record visibility status
- Three states: Private (Lock), Organization (Globe), Shared (Users)
- Configurable sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Optional label display
- Color-coded for quick recognition

### 5. Security Enhancements

**Superuser Support**
- Added `is_superuser` column to profiles table
- Automatically marked admin emails as superusers
- Used in RLS policies for admin override
- Indexed for performance

**Profile Auto-Creation**
- Existing trigger ensures every user has a profile
- Role inferred from email domain (@mympb.com)
- Default values prevent null role scenarios

**Audit Logging**
- All share/unshare actions logged to `audit_logs`
- Includes actor, target, and metadata
- Enables compliance reporting

### 6. AuthContext Optimization

**Already Well-Implemented**
- Profile caching with 5-minute TTL
- Memory and localStorage cache layers
- Deduplication of concurrent profile fetches
- Automatic refresh on auth state changes
- Clean cache invalidation on logout

**Single Source of Truth**
- No client-side role manipulation
- All role checks use `profile.role` from Supabase
- `profileReady` flag prevents flicker

### 7. Routing Improvements

**Existing Structure Preserved**
- DualDashboardApp already has proper role guards
- CEOOnly and CTOOnly components enforce boundaries
- RoleBasedRedirect handles default routing
- CEO routes under `/ceod/*`, CTO under `/ctod/*`
- Shared routes under `/shared/*` accessible to both

**Simplified Logic**
- Removed complex client-side role switching
- `shouldShowCTOSidebar` based on route and profile state
- Clean separation of CEO and CTO UI shells

await createRecord.mutateAsync({
  record_type: 'report',
  visibility: 'private',
  title: 'Q4 Financial Summary',
  content: 'Detailed analysis...',
  metadata: { quarter: 'Q4', year: 2025 }
});
```

### Sharing a Record with CTO

```typescript
const shareRecord = useShareRecord();

await shareRecord.mutateAsync({
  record_id: 'uuid-here',
  target_role: 'cto',
  can_edit: false // view-only
});
```

### Fetching Shared Records

```typescript
const { data: records } = useRecords({
  visibility: 'shared',
  record_type: 'kpi'
});

// Records automatically filtered by RLS policies
// CEO sees records shared with 'ceo' role
// CTO sees records shared with 'cto' role
```

### Displaying Visibility

```typescript
<RecordVisibilityBadge
  visibility={record.visibility}
  size="md"
  showLabel={true}
/>
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Data

If you have existing data in other tables that should use the new shared model:

```sql
-- Migrate existing data to records table
INSERT INTO public.records (org_id, owner_id, record_type, visibility, title, content, metadata)
SELECT
  org_id,
  user_id,
  'report'::text,
  'private'::text,
  title,
  description,
  jsonb_build_object('legacy_id', id)
FROM public.legacy_reports;
```

### For Existing Users

All existing users will automatically have:
- Profile with role based on email
- Access to their own records
- Ability to share new records
- No migration needed

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: User can't see shared records**
- Check `record_shares` table for matching `target_role` or `target_user`
- Verify record `visibility` is set to 'shared'
- Check user's `profile.role` matches target_role

**Issue: Admin can't access records**
- Verify `is_superuser` flag is set in profiles table
- Check `is_admin()` function returns true
- Ensure RLS policies include `OR public.is_admin()`

**Issue: Share modal doesn't show**
- Check record ownership (`owner_id = auth.uid()`)
- Verify user has permission to share
- Check console for JavaScript errors

### Debug Queries

```sql
-- Check RLS policies for records table
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'records';

-- Check user's current role
SELECT public.current_role();

-- Check if user is admin
SELECT public.is_admin();

-- View all shares for a record
SELECT * FROM public.record_shares WHERE record_id = 'uuid-here';
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for enterprise collaboration between CEO and CTO roles while maintaining strict security boundaries. The shared data model with RLS ensures that data access is controlled at the database level, preventing unauthorized access even if client-side code is compromised.

All new features are production-ready, fully typed, and follow React/Supabase best practices. The codebase is maintainable, scalable, and ready for additional features as outlined in the roadmap above.

**Build Status**: ✅ All systems operational
**Security**: ✅ RLS enforced at database level
**Performance**: ✅ Optimized with caching and indexes
**User Experience**: ✅ Smooth, flicker-free role routing
