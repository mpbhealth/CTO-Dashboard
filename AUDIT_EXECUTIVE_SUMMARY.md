## üìù What Developers Should Know

### For Maintenance
- **Navigation**: Edit `/src/config/navigation.ts` only
- **Routes**: Add to `DualDashboardApp.tsx`
- **Guards**: Use `CEOOnly` or `CTOOnly` wrappers
- **Types**: Database types in `/src/types/database.ts`
- **Styles**: Tailwind classes, no custom CSS needed

### For New Features
1. Add navigation item to config file
2. Create lazy-loaded component
3. Add route with appropriate guard
4. Update RLS policies if needed
5. Test with both CEO and CTO roles

### For Debugging
```javascript
// In browser console:
diagnose()          // Run health check
clearAllCaches()    // Clear all caches and reload
```
