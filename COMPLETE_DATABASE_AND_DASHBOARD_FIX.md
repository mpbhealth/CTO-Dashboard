# Complete Dashboard Fix - Database & Error Resolution

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED
**Build:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved all dashboard errors and created complete database infrastructure for both CTO and CEO dashboards. All pages now load correctly with real data from Supabase.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Compliance Dashboard Error
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'approved')`
**Fix:** Updated `useComplianceDashboard` hook to return complete data structure
**Result:** Compliance Command Center now loads without errors

### 2. ✅ Missing Database Tables
**Error:** `Could not find the table 'public.kpis' in the schema cache`
**Fix:** Created all missing tables with proper RLS policies
**Result:** All dashboard features now have database backing

---

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

All tables have proper RLS policies:

**CTO & Admin:**
- ✅ Full read/write access to all tables
- ✅ Can create, update, and delete records

**CEO:**
- ✅ Read access to roadmap, projects, technologies
- ✅ Full access to KPIs and compliance data

**Staff:**
- ✅ View own assignments
- ✅ Update own assignment status
- ✅ Manage own notes and quick links

**Example Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "CTO and admin full access to roadmap"
  ON public.roadmap_items FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.role IN ('cto', 'admin')
    )
  );
```

## Data Access Patterns

### How Components Access Data

```typescript
// Example: Roadmap page
import { getRoadmapItems } from '../lib/data/roadmap';

// Component fetches from Supabase
const { data, error } = await getRoadmapItems();

// Data flows through shared module
// Both CTO and CEO see same data
```

### Shared Data Layer Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One query function per entity
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data
3. **Consistency**: CTO and CEO always see same data
4. **Maintainability**: Change query in one place
5. **Security**: RLS enforces permissions at database level

---

## Database Schema Notes

### Constraint Values (Important!)

**Roadmap Items:**
- Status: `'Backlog'`, `'In Progress'`, `'Complete'` (case-sensitive!)
- Priority: `'Low'`, `'Medium'`, `'High'` (case-sensitive!)

**Projects:**
- Status: `'Planning'`, `'Building'`, `'Live'` (case-sensitive!)
- Progress: 0-100 (integer)

**Technologies:**
- Status: `'active'`, `'deprecated'`, `'planned'`, `'evaluating'`

### Existing Schema (Already Had)
The database already had these tables from previous migrations:
- `roadmap_items` - Different schema than expected
- `projects` - Different schema than expected
- Other tables adjusted to match existing structure

## How to Use the Dashboard Now

### For CTO:
1. Login with CTO credentials
2. Navigate to `/ctod/development/tech-stack` - See tech inventory
3. Navigate to `/ctod/development/roadmap` - View product roadmap
4. Navigate to `/ctod/development/projects` - Manage projects
5. Navigate to `/ctod/compliance/dashboard` - Monitor compliance
6. All data is editable and persistent

### For CEO:
1. Login with CEO credentials
2. Navigate to `/ceod/development/roadmap` - View roadmap (read-only)
3. Navigate to `/ceod/development/projects` - View projects
4. Same data as CTO, synchronized in real-time
5. Executive-focused views and summaries

### Adding New Data:
```sql
-- Add a new technology
INSERT INTO public.technologies
  (name, category, description, version, status, vendor, cost)
VALUES
  ('Docker', 'Infrastructure', 'Containerization platform', '24.x', 'active', 'Docker Inc', 0);

-- Add a new roadmap item
INSERT INTO public.roadmap_items
  (title, description, status, priority, quarter, owner, department)
VALUES
  ('New Feature', 'Description', 'Backlog', 'Medium', 'Q1 2026', 'Team', 'Dept');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page shows "No data"
**Solution:** Data is loaded. Refresh the page or check RLS policies.

### Issue: Can't add new records
**Solution:** Ensure you're logged in with proper role (CTO/Admin for most tables).

### Issue: Data not synchronized between dashboards
**Solution:** Both dashboards query same tables. Clear cache and refresh.

### Issue: Constraint violation errors
**Solution:** Check constraint values above. Use exact capitalization.
