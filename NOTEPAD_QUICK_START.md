# Notepad Sharing - Quick Start Guide

## What's New

Your CEO and CTO dashboards now have **independent notepads with sharing capabilities**. Each dashboard has its own private notes, but you can share specific notes with the other role when needed.

## Quick Actions

### Create a Private Note
1. Go to Notes page in your dashboard
2. Click "Personal" button
3. Type your note
4. Click "Save Note"

### Create Note for Other Dashboard
1. Click "Create For..." button
2. Write your note
3. Choose "View Only" or "Can Edit"
4. (Optional) Add a message
5. Click "Create & Share"

### Share Existing Note
1. Find your note
2. Click the share icon (↗)
3. Choose permission level
4. Click "Share Note"

### Check Notifications
1. Click bell icon (🔔) in top right
2. See who shared what with you
3. Click to view the note

## View Filters

- **All Notes**: Everything you can see
- **My Notes**: Only your personal notes
- **Shared**: Only notes others shared with you

## Permission Levels

- **👁️ View Only**: They can read but not edit
- **✏️ Can Edit**: They can read and modify

## Key Points

✅ Your notes are **private by default**
✅ Sharing is **explicit** - nothing shared unless you choose to
✅ You control **who can edit** your shared notes
✅ You can **unshare** anytime
✅ Get **notifications** when notes are shared with you
✅ **Real-time updates** - changes appear instantly
